  <h2>Intro</h2>
  <p>Hello!  I'm Kae, a software developer living in Eau Claire, Wisconsin.  I have been an independent contractor massage therapist since 2008 and I own a chiropractic office with my husband.  As a business owner I understand:   
    <ul>
      <li>The flexibility needed when the unexpected happens.</li>
      <li>The demands of customer service.</li>
      <li>Insurance and healthcare intricacies.</li>
    </ul></p>

    <h2>About</h2>
    <p>I am a mother of five.  I own three dogs and five chickens.  Life is busy!  The pandemic showed me that being able to work from home is a gift.  Looking to increase my income while staying home (as well as using rudimentary coding in Minecraft at the behest of my teenage boys) led me to the software engineering program at <a href="thinkful.com/learn/" target="_blank">Thinkful</a>.  I have enjoyed the challenges that come with coding and everyone I come into contact with is hearing about my learning journey!  I am hoping to begin working by the end of 2021 and would love to collaborate on projects at GitHub</p>
